## Prerequisites

#### Installing Python

Make sure that you have [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) installed on your machine.

You might want to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) standard Python library
to create virtual environments and have Python, `pip` and all dependent packages to be installed and 
served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their 
versions.

#### Launching Jupyter Locally

To launch [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) locally you may do it by running the following command from the root folder of the project:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
After this Jupyter Notebook will be accessible by `http://localhost:8888`.

## Datasets

The list of datasets that is being used for Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php).
